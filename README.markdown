What started as a very simple implementation of (a small subset of) Peano numbers, as an exercise in exploring [rantly](https://github.com/hayeah/rantly).

By adding inverses to the Peano numbers, we implement the group of integers under +.

A trampoline allows us to express the natural recursive definitions in constant space.

We violate standard OO doctrine and switch on types to concentrate the various algorithms each in one place.
